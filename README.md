# MeetupRaffleApplicationDaggerExample
A quick and dirty Meetup Raffle application using Dagger. Disclaimer: This is not how I normally develop Android applications as this was thrown together in a couple hours the night before the presentation. This has no error handling and no performance considerations


To get the example to work, in MeetupConfiguration, update the API key value with your own Meetup API Key

I've used Android Studio 2 Beta 6 to develop this. You can grab it at: https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/download/studio/canary/latest
